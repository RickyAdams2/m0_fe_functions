# Self Evaluation

- Reflect on your time management and awareness of where you spend time. Is this a strength or area you are working on? What support do you need in this area? And/or, what tips do you have to share with your classmates in this area?
Time management has always been a hard one for me. Since I've also been working full time, it has been a bit harder for me to have time for both. However, I will say I have done better than I expected. I know once I leave my job at the end of the month, and have time to solely focus on school, it will be easier for me to manage my time effectively. Between working, attempting to get adequate rest and relaxation time, and handling learning something completely new to me, it has been a struggle. I know that I need time to focus on getting myself prepared for school, and get used to doing school work again.

- How would you explain to a 5 year old what a function is? I would describe a function to a 5 year old, by comparing it to following instructions. A function is like a set of directions. It tells the computer what to do.

- Share your understanding of arguments and parameters. I understand that parameters are like the variable for a function. They inform the programmer of what is being assessed. For example, in the previous lesson when we were writing functions to inform the computer of which items were running low. The parameter was checkStock because that was subject we were relaying to the computer. I understand that arguments are the data that has the direction that the function needs to follow. For example, the argument expresses what the code should print out to once the correct variables are in place.
- What questions/topics (related to Functions) do you want to bring to your Small Group?
